# Academic projects

These are the projects list which are done by me, and the variety of these projecs goes from Machine Learning, Deep learning to full-stack web dev using different frameworks

Project 1: It is based on a research where we compared different state of the art computer vision architectures ranging from CNN's to object detection models like yolo and detectron to make out a model analysis on which model is better performing when they are provided with the same amount of data samples using customly prepared dataset , we have used CNN's RNN's, Vision Transformer model(ViT) and object detection models like(Yolov5 and Detectron_v3)

and this research got published in IEEE xplore: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=Akhilesh%20Babu%20Tumati

Project 2: Crypto currency prediction is done by using ARIMA and SARIMA time series models, and the dataset is imported from yahoo finance and some of the model structural references are taken from kaggle.
